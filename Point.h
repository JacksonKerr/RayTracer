/** \brief Class for Point Vectors.
 *
 * A Point can be seen as either a 3-Vector or a homogeneous 4-Vector.
 * In this implementation a Point is a 3-Vector, and the Transform 
 * class deals with the homogeneous form. Point is essentially a thin
 * wrapper around Vector, which ensures that the Vector has 3 elements.
 *
 * Having separate types for Point, Direction, and Normal, means that 
 * it is possible to distinguish them when passing them to  Transform.apply() etc.
