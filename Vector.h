/**
 * \brief Basic class for vectors.
 *
 * A Vector is a Matrix with exactly one column, and in many cases can be dealt with as such.
 * However, having a separate Vector class means that we can implement Vector-specific behaviour like dot and cross products.
 * Since all Vectors are Matrices, Vector is a subclass of Matrix.
 *
 * Many Matrix operations (such as + and *) are overloaded in cases when a Vector is gauranteed to be the result.
 * Thus Matrix*Vector is overloaded (it is always a Vector), but Vector*Matrix is not - we can just use Matrix*Matrix for that.
 * Most of these just call the Matrix equivalents, so this provides some convenience at the cost of a layer of redirecton.
 * 
 * Note that a Vector as a mathematical object, is quite distinct from a std:vector, which is essentially an array.
