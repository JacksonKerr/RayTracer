/**
 * \brief Class for Normal Vectors.
 *
 * A Normal can be seen as either a 3-Vector or a homogeneous 4-Vector.
 * It can also be seen as a special sort of Direction. In this implementation
 * a Normal is stored as a 3-Vector and the Transform class deals with the
 * homogeneous form. Normal is a thin wrapper around Vector, which ensures
 * that the Vector has 3 elements.
 *
 * Having separate types for Point, Direction, and Normal means that it is 
 * possible to distinguish them when passing them to Transform.apply() etc.
