/**
 * \brief Abstract base class for Objects.
 *
 * An Object is a geometric entity that can be seen in a camera, such as a Sphere. 
 * The term 'Object' is commonly used, but creates a bit of tension 
 * with the 'object' in 'object-oriented programming'. For this documentation a 'big-O' 
 * Object is a thing that can be seen by a camera, and a 'little-o' object is a data 
 * structure with members and methods etc. Hopefully this will be clear from context 
 * anyway.
 *
 * Different types of Object are distinguished primarily by their intersect() functions,
 * which determine how a given Ray intersects the surface of the Object. An Object is 
 * usually created at the origin with some standard dimensions. They can then me moved,
 * rotated, and resized through their transform member.
 *
 * As an abstract base class, you cannot create an Object directly.
 * Instead one of its concrete subclasses must be created.

	 * of RayIntersections is returned.
	 *
	 * The details of this depend on the geometry of the particular Object, so this is a 
	 * pure virtual method.
