/**
 * \brief NonCopyable class.
 *
 * Sometimes it doesn't make sense for an object to be duplicated. This may be for
 * technical reasons (such as the class representing a limited physical resoruce), 
 * and sometimes for practical reasons (such as the class storing lots of information).
 * In C++ this can be enforced by explicitly deleting the copy constructor and assignment 
 * operator, or by making them private.
 * The NonCopyable class makes this easy and less error prone to do. To make a
 * class NonCopyable, just inherit (privately) from NonCopyable:
 * \code
 *  class MyClassCannotBeCopied: private NonCopyable {
 *    ...
 *  };
 * \endcode
