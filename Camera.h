 *
 * Cameras are the primary source of rays in a scene. A camera 
 * is defined by its castRay() function, which generates a ray
 * given image plane co-ordinates.
 *
 * As an abstract base class, you cannot create a Camera directly.
 * Instead one of its concrete subclasses must be created.

	/** \brief Generate a ray for a given image plane co-ordinate
	 *
	 * Given a point on a virtual image plane, this method generates a ray
	 * for a given camera model. Note that image plane co-ordinates are not 
	 * the same as pixel co-ordinates. There are two main differences:
	 * - The origin of the image plane co-ordinates are in the centre of 
	 * the image plane, while pixels usually count from the top left corner.
	 * - Image plane co-ordinates are continuous (real) values, wheras
	 * pixel values are discrete.
	 *
	 * By convention, x-values are in the range [-1,1], and the range of
	 * y-values depends on the aspect ratio of the image. For wide (landscape)
	 * images y-values will lie in a narrower range, while for tall (portrait)
	 * images, y-values will exceed this range. This is, however, merely a 
	 * convention so is neither required nor enforced.
	 *
	 * \param x the horizontal location
	 * \param y the vertical location
	 * \return The Ray that passes from the Camera through (x,y) in the image plane.
