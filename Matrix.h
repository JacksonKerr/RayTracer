 * This class provides basic matrix operatations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) as overloaded operators.
 * This is sufficient for COSC432 and the Ray Tracer assignment, but does not include more advanced operations like inverse, or matrix decompositions.
 *
 * The class is designed to be simple and easy to understand rather than optimal or hyper-efficient.
 * For production code a more professional library (such as <a href="http://http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a>) is recommended.
