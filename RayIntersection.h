 * A RayIntersection stores the information about this intersection. As well as 
 * the Point at which the intersection occurs, the Normal to the object at that location,
 * the Material of the object, and the distance along the ray are all required.
 *
 * RayInteresections can also be sorted on distance along the ray.
